										<h3>About this Study</h3>
									</header>
                                    <h4>American Literary Magazines in Transition, 1995–2004</h4>
									<p>This study will examine two groups of creative producers in the poetry field: (a) poetry editors and (b) poets. Their shared, sustained interactions in the production of literary magazines will be examined in the context of the system of relationships between community members (poets and poetry editors); activities (solicitation and submission, magazine production, and distribution); and the larger publishing world (presses, networks, and reviewers) in the early years of web adoption from their perspective as creators and gatekeepers. The primary purpose of this study is to understand the transformation in participation in the production of literary magazines as a particular genre that articulates the American poetry field during the period of 1995–2004.</p>
				
                                    <h4>Number of Participants &amp; Duration of the Study</h4>
									<p>Twelve poets and 12 poetry editors will take part in this study with individual participation lasting approximately 90 minutes to four hours over the course of three weeks during spring 2021.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>Why 1995–2004?</h4>
									<p>The period selected for this dissertation begins with the first full-content “Web Only” issue of a literary magazine in 1995 and concludes with the online launch of one of the most significant institutions in the field of poetry&mdash;Poetry Foundation&mdash;at the start of 2005. In order to offer historical analysis for comparison of the shift in the poetry community after the emergence of the World Wide Web, the study will trace poetry editors and poets who were active in the production of poetry from 1995 to 2004.</p>
                                    
                                    <h4>What is the Research Question?</h4>
                                    The research questions this study answers are: <ul><li><em>How did poetry editors and poets share and construct knowledge, specifically in the production of American poetry magazines from 1995 to 2004?</em></li><li><em>How were the practices surrounding the production of poetry magazines altered by the emergence of Web-based literary magazines?</em></li><li><em>How did the products of the poetry community change between 1995 and 2004?</em></li><li><em>How did the changes in literary magazine production practices impact the way poets and poetry editors saw themselves in relation to the field?</em></li></ul>
                                    
                                    <h4>What is the Study Design?</h4>
                                    <p>This study will be conducted with 12 poets and 12 poetry editors who were active in the production of American poetry magazines between 1995 and 2004. Poetry editors will be selected from the <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/directory-of-literary-magazines-1994-95/oclc/243484655" target="_blank">1994&mdash;1995 issue of <i>Directory of Literary Magazines</i></a>. Poets will be selected from the <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/directory-of-american-poets-and-fiction-writers-names-and-addresses-of-7000-contemporary-poets-and-fiction-writers-whose-work-has-been-published-in-the-united-states/oclc/32343739" target="_blank">1994&mdash;1995 issue of <i>A Directory of American Poets and Fiction Writers</i></a>. Poets and poetry editors will be selected from five U.S. regions (Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest, and West). Poetry editors will be chosen from the three formats available in 1995 (web, print with web version, and print), and poets will be selected based on level of consecration in the field (emerging, middle, estabilished). The study design is based on qualitative research methods. Data will be collected from transcripts of semi-structured interviews and documents and texts produced by the poets and poetry editors.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Title of Study</strong>: American Literary Magazines in Transition, 1995&mdash;2004<br /><strong>Principal Investigator</strong>: Nathan Graham, Doctoral Candidate</p>
                                    <p>This consent form is part of an informed consent process for a research study and it will provide information that will help you decide whether you want to take part in this study. It is your choice to take part or not. After all of your questions have been answered and you wish to take part in the research study, you will be asked to sign this consent form. You will be given a signed form to keep. Your alternative to taking part in the research is not to take part in it.</p>
                                    <h5>Who is taking part in this research study and what is it about?</h5>
                                    <p>You are being asked to take part in research being conducted by Nathan Graham, who is a doctoral candidate in the School of Communication and Information. The <strong>purpose of this study</strong> is to understand the practices involved in the production of literary magazines as a particular genre that articulates the American poetry field during the emergence of Web-based literary magazines (1995–2004). As such, social dimensions of this phenomenon, including creation and production practices, will be studied from the perspectives of two groups of creative stakeholders in the field of literary magazine production: (a) poetry editors (production and dissemination) and (b) poets (creation), using a cultural and historical framework. If you take part in the research, you will be asked to participate in a single interview session where you will be asked questions about the literary community between 1995 and 2004. The interview will be conducted over Zoom, a web conferencing tool, and audio and video of the interview will be recorded. The interview recording will then be manually transcribed by the principal investigator, Nathan Graham. You will be provided with the interview recording and transcript and asked to provide optional reflection and revision notes. Your time in the study will take up to 90 minutes for the interview and then up to three hours to review the interview recording and provide reflection and/or revision notes.</p>
                                    <h5>What will I be asked to do if I take part?</h5>
                                    <p>The interview will take about 90 minutes to complete. We anticipate 12 poets and 12 poetry editors will take part in the study. Participation in this study requires audio recording with optional video recording over a web conferencing tool. The recording will be stored on an encyrpted hard drive. The recording will be transcribed by the principal investigator. The recording and transcription will be provided to you and you will have the option to revise the transcript. You can then choose to contribute the transcript and recording to the data set or withdraw from the study altogether.</p>
                                    <h5>What are the risks and/or discomforts I might experience or benefits if I take part in the study?</h5>
                                    <p>Possible harms or burdens of taking part in the study may be offending poetry community members who were active at that time and/or living family and friends of any named community member, and possible benefits of taking part may be increased visibility and historical context of your projects, poems, and accomplishments from this period.</p>
                                    <h5>Will I be paid to take part in this study?</h5>
                                    <p>No, you will not be paid to take part in this study.</p>
                                    <h5>How will information about me be kept private or confidential?</h5>
                                    <p>You will have three privacy options during this study: a) you can choose to have your interview recording and transcription remain confidential, b) you can choose to waive confidentiality and have your full name, associated recording, and transcription included in the study, or c) you can choose not to participate and leave the study at any time.  If you choose to waive confidentiality, I will ask you to provide your full name during the interview. The identifiable information, including full name and recording, will be stored with your interview transcript. When the study is complete, your full name, interview recording, and/or transcript may be published. However, if you choose to have your information included confidentially, your responses will be assigned a subject # which will be stored separately from your identifiable information so others will not know which responses are yours. When the study is complete, your identifiable information will be destroyed so no link will exist between your identity and your responses. No information that can identify you will appear in any professional presentation or publication.</p>
                                    <h5>What will happen to information I provide in the research after the study is over?</h5>
                                    <p>If you choose to waive confidentiallity, your identifiable information, including full name, recording, and/or transcript data may be used by or distributed to investigators for other research without obtaining additional consent from you. If you choose to participate confidentially, after information that could identify you has been removed, de-identified interview transcript data may be used by or distributed to investigators for other research without obtaining additional informed consent from you. At any time during the study, you can choose to stop participating and all data collected will be destroyed.</p>
                                    <h5>What will happen if I do not want to take part or decide later not to stay in the study?</h5>
                                    <p>Your participation is voluntary. If you choose to take part now, you may change your mind and withdraw later. In addition, you can choose to skip interview questions that you are not comfortable answering or stop the interview at any time. You may also withdraw your consent for use of responses you provided during the interview, but you must do this in writing to the PI, Nathan Graham at grahamn@scarletmail.rutgers.edu.</p>
                                    <h5>Who can I call if I have questions?</h5>
                                    <p>If you have questions about taking part in this study, you can contact the Principal Investigator: Nathan Graham, Rutgers, School of Communication and Information, grahamn@scarletmail.rutgers.edu. You can also contact my faculty advisor, <a href="https://comminfo.rutgers.edu/dalbello-marija" target="_blank">Marija Dalbello</a></p>
